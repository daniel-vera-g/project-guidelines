### Prerequisites

A good markdown editor or [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert the files.

With pandoc you can convert markdown files using the script located in the tools folder. Just navigate to the folder with your terminal and execute:

`chmod +x ./pdf-convert.sh && ./pdf-convert.sh`

* NOTE: Pandoc has to be installed. To convert to pdf, you will need some latex renderer.

## TODO

> See the issues list.

## Acknowledgments

* Each file has some sources, where I got inspired.
* Sometimes I just took over the information.
