# Semantic versioning

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
* PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
* Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
