# Writing Things Down and Sharing - aka RFCs

1. Do planning before building something new

* Whiteboarding
* Talking it through with the team members
* Be clear on how you will get things done.

2. Capture this plan in a short, written document

* relatively quick write down the "how" -> Don't go overboard

3. Have a few, select people approve this plan before starting work

* Good quality gate to only merge a pull request after someone does a review on it
* A few, relevant people validate the planned work

4. Send this planning document out to all engineers in the company and let anyone and everyone comment on it

## Kanban Board
