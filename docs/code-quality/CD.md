# Continuos delivery & continuos deployment

> Ensure that code can be shipped at any time & every change is automatically deployed to production

* COMMENT: Be aware, that continuos delivery is not best used with branching models like gitflow.

## CD Workflow

1. After running CI in feature branches & merge into development branch
2. Run continuos delivery, when merging the development branch into master
3. Use Docker for continuos deployment
